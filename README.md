# Verity

Verity is a rarely used English word meaning "Truth" and that's what the Bible is: the Truth.

Psalm 119:160 tells us, "The sum of your word is Truth, and every one of your righteous rules endures forever"
John 17:17 has Jesus asking God the Father to "Sanctify them in the Truth, your word is Truth"

This project aims to serve up the Bible in a user friendly way and make study (especially in original languages) easier and more profitable without having to fork out for expensive bible programs.

## What is Verity?

This is the home of The Verity Project. We're actually still under construction. Verity, for now, is a desktop application like Microsoft Word or Mozilla Firefox that puts the Bible at your fingertips. Now that's exciting!

Verity is aimed at those who are interested in the languages the Bible was originally written in. Verity aims to display and make accessible all the hard work that people have put into original language digital texts and dictionaries.

## Why should I use Verity?

To be honest, at this point Verity's offerings over other Bible Software programs may seem thin on the ground but to name a few:

 - Continuous Scrolling (in other words, you can see multiple chapters)
 - Advanced Parallel View (which correctly lines verses up with their counterparts in other versions [often English translations have different verse numbers to the Hebrew manuscripts])
 - Open Source (Verity's source code is free to view and modify which means that anyone can make it better, even you!)
